# Sparse Matrix Assignment

## Introduction  
Welcome to my Sparse Matrix Assignment repository. This project is designed to efficiently handle and operate on sparse matrices, which are large matrices where most elements are zero. The implementation focuses on memory optimization and computational efficiency while ensuring correctness in operations.

This project supports essential matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication. It also includes proper error handling to detect incorrect file formats and unexpected inputs.

## Project Structure  
The repository is organized as follows:  

- code/src – Contains the core implementation of the sparse matrix and its operations  
- sample_inputs – Stores test data files for validation  
- README.md – Documentation for understanding and using this repository  
- .gitignore – Specifies files that should be excluded from version control  

## Features  
This project provides the following functionality:  

- Efficient representation and storage of sparse matrices  
- File handling for reading and processing matrix data from input files  
- Implementation of matrix operations including addition, subtraction, and multiplication  
- Error handling for incorrect input formats and missing values  
- Well-organized and structured codebase for maintainability  

## Getting Started  
To begin using this repository, clone it to your local machine:
